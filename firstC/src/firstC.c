/*********************************************************************
 *
 * These C functions use patterns and functionality often found in
 * operating system code. Your job is to implement them. Of course you
 * should write test cases. However, do not hand in your test cases
 * and (especially) do not hand in a main() function since it will
 * interfere with our tester.
 *
 * Additional requirements on all functions you write:
 *
 * - you may not refer to any global variables
 *
 * - you may not call any functions except those specifically
 *   permitted in the specification
 *
 * - your code must compile successfully on CADE lab Linux
 *   machines when using:
 *
 * /usr/bin/gcc -O2 -fmessage-length=0 -pedantic-errors -std=c99 -Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wwrite-strings -Winit-self -Wcast-align -Wcast-qual -Wpointer-arith -Wstrict-aliasing -Wformat=2 -Wmissing-include-dirs -Wno-unused-parameter -Wshadow -Wuninitialized -Wold-style-definition -c assign1.c
 *
 * NOTE 1: Some of the specifications below are specific to 64-bit
 * machines, such as those found in the CADE lab.  If you choose to
 * develop on 32-bit machines, some quantities (the size of an
 * unsigned long and the size of a pointer) will change. Since we will
 * be grading on 64-bit machines, you must make sure your code works
 * there.
 *
 * NOTE 2: You should not need to include any additional header files,
 * but you may do so if you feel that it helps.
 *
 * HANDIN: submit your finished file, still called assign.c, in Canvas

 * draw_me()
 *
 * this function creates a file called me.txt which contains an ASCII-art
 * picture of you (it does not need to be very big). the file must (pointlessly,
 * since it does not contain executable content) be marked as executable.
 *
 * extra requirement 1: you may only call the function syscall() (type "man
 * syscall" to see what this does)
 *
 * extra requirement 2: you must ensure that every system call succeeds; if any
 * fails, you must clean up the system state (closing any open files, deleting
 * any files created in the file system, etc.) such that no trash is left
 * sitting around
 *
 * you might be wondering how to learn what system calls to use and what
 * arguments they expect. one way is to look at a web page like this one:
 * http://blog.rchapman.org/post/36801038863/linux-system-call-table-for-x86-64
 * another thing you can do is write some C code that uses standard I/O
 * functions to draw the picture and mark it as executable, compile the program
 * statically (e.g. "gcc foo.c -O -static -o foo"), and then disassemble it
 * ("objdump -d foo") and look at how the system calls are invoked, then do
 * the same thing manually using syscall()
